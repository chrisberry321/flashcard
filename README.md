#  CODE REVIEW

#### JavaScript and jQuery Code review, 1/15/2016

#### By Chris Berry

## Description

A Form gathers inputs from the user. _jQuery_ is used to show and hide the destination after questions are answered and submitted and the site uses branching to return destination. Also, it is styled using _Bootstrap_ and custom _CSS_ with box model and floats.
Variable names are descriptive of what they represent.
HTML tags, p, h, ul, ol, li, em. strong, a, img, div, and span will be used.

## Support and contact details

If you have any troubles ideas or concerns feel free to contact me at chrisberry321@yahoo.com and I will help if I can. I am still learning so if you would like to copy this repository and make contributions it would be greatly appreciated.  

## Technologies Used

One of the note worthy parts of code in this project is found in the js/scripts.js file. It demonstrates two different approaches to applying inputs to show different results. One of these is blacked out so the operation isn't run twice but either one will preform the same task.
